# Full Stack Starter - Svelte and Express

*Looking for a shareable component template? Go here --> [sveltejs/component-template](https://github.com/sveltejs/component-template)*

---

## svelte app

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Express app

This app uses Node and Express as the backend. To start the backend run:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Full Stack Startup

To develop the frontend and the backend together run the following:

```bash
yarn dev
```

To create an optimized and minified production bundle, run this:
```bash
yarn build
```
